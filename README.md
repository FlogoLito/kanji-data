# Kanji Data

This repository contains a JSON file ([kanji.json](kanji.json)) combining all of the kanji information that I found relevant to my study of the language and my Japanese related projects.

Most of the information is what's provided by the KANJIDIC dataset, but converted to JSON for ease of use, stripped of information I didn't need, and most importantly, with updated JLPT levels and extra WaniKani information, both of which are relevant to me.

The Python scripts used to extract and organize all of the data are also provided.
