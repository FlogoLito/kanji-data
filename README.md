# Kanji Data

This repository contains a JSON file ([kanji.json](kanji.json)) combining all of the kanji information that I found relevant to my studies of the Japanese language.

Most of the data is the same as the KANJIDIC dataset, but converted to JSON for ease of use, stripped of information I didn't need, and improved with updated JLPT levels and WaniKani content.

The Python scripts used to extract and organize all of the data are also provided.
